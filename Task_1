In this task i have to install kali linux in my PC.
Steps are:
To install Kali Linux in VirtualBox on a Windows host PC, you can follow these steps:

1.)Download VirtualBox:
      If you haven't already installed VirtualBox, you can download it from the official website: https://www.virtualbox.org/
2.)Download Kali Linux:
      Download the Kali Linux ISO image from the official website: https://www.kali.org/downloads/
3.)Install VirtualBox:
      Run the VirtualBox installer you downloaded in step 1 and follow the installation instructions.
4.)Create a New Virtual Machine:
    Open VirtualBox and click on the "New" button to create a new virtual machine.
5.)Configure Virtual Machine Settings:

     Name your virtual machine (e.g., "Kali Linux").
     Select the "Linux" operating system and "Debian (64-bit)" as the version.
     Allocate memory to the virtual machine. A minimum of 2 GB is recommended, but more is better if you have the resources.
     Create a new virtual hard disk or use an existing one. Allocate at least 20 GB of space for the virtual hard disk.

6.)Install Kali Linux:

    Select your newly created virtual machine in VirtualBox and click "Start."
    When prompted, select the Kali Linux ISO file you downloaded in step 2 as the bootable media.
    Follow the Kali Linux installer prompts to set your language, location, keyboard layout, and create a root password.
    When you reach the disk partitioning step, you can choose the guided method or manually partition the disk. If you're unsure, the guided method is usually sufficient.
    Wait for the installation to complete.
7.)Configure Kali Linux:
   After installation, Kali Linux will prompt you to configure network mirrors. You can use the default mirrors or select ones geographically closer to you.
   Update and upgrade Kali Linux by opening a terminal and running:
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt upgrade
8.)Restart the pc
